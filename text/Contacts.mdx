## Adding Contacts

1. Go to the **Contacts** tab.
2. Click on the **( + )** button.
3. Fill in the contact information (add as much as possible!).
4. Click **Create Contact**.

### Best Practices When Creating a Contact

- **Notes** – Add any observations or details about the customer to track preferences, past issues, or context.
- **Tags** – Categorize your contacts using tags (city, role, lead stage, etc.).
  - Click the **( + )** button to create new tags.
  - After adding a tag to a contact, you can filter by that tag:
    - Go to your **Inbox**.
    - Click **Search**.
    - Select **Filter by Tags**.
    - Choose the tag you want to filter.

Any information you add to a contact is **shared with everyone**. Each team member can maintain their own notes and tags.
